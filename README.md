# CourseManagement

This solution is structured following the principles of Clean Architecture, which emphasizes separation of concerns and independence of frameworks, UI, and databases. The architecture is divided into several layers, each with a specific responsibility.

### Layers Explained

- **Application Layer**: This layer contains the business logic of the application. It includes services and use cases that orchestrate the flow of data to and from the domain layer. The interfaces here define the contracts for the services used by the application.

- **Domain Layer**: The core of the application, this layer contains the business rules and logic. It includes entities, value objects, and domain services. This layer is independent of any other layer, making it highly reusable and testable.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: This layer provides implementations for the interfaces defined in the application and domain layers. It includes data access logic, external service integrations, and other infrastructure concerns.

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for handling user interactions. It includes controllers and models that facilitate communication between the user interface and the application layer.

- **Tests**: This directory contains unit tests for each layer, ensuring that the application behaves as expected and that each component functions correctly. The subdirectories are organized as follows:
  - **ApplicationTests**: Contains tests for the Application Layer, verifying the business logic and service orchestration.
  - **DomainTests**: Contains tests for the Domain Layer, ensuring the correctness of business rules and logic.
  - **InfrastructureTests**: Contains tests for the Infrastructure Layer, validating data access and external service integrations.

## Clean Architecture Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Independence**: The architecture is independent of frameworks, UI, and databases, allowing for flexibility and adaptability.
- **Testability**: The separation of concerns and clear boundaries between layers make the application highly testable.

This structure ensures that the application is scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to changes in technology or business requirements.
